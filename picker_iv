## 🕵️‍♂️ Description

Our goal is to retrieve the flag. Looking at the binary’s source, it’s clear that the win function is responsible for printing the flag. 


The program also prompts the user with:
“Enter the address in hex to jump to.”

This means that if we can determine the address of win and provide it as input, the binary will jump directly to that function and reveal the flag.

To locate the address of win, we can use gdb. After loading the binary, the info functions command lists all function symbols along with their memory addresses.
